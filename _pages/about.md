Hello! I am Yao. I am interested in software development and cybersecurity. Currently, I am an intern for California Department of Public Health. I help to make their upcoming IOS app more secure.

I graduated Cal State Fullerton with B.S. in Computer Science. Currently, I am pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at Cal Poly Pomona.

In my free time, I enjoy biking and playing video game. My favorite game is Minecraft.

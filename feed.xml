I still remember the first time I wiped Windows 10 off of my laptop and installed Manjaro. I have installed Arch in the command line and use i3wm, but I have long moved away from Arch because of the package manager pacman. Here is what I am currently running on:</p> <h3 id="debian--dwm">Debian + dwm</h3> <p>I have decided to run Debian because of APT. I prefer my package from a stable version. In addition to APT, I use Nix package manager for projects. For example, I need the one library to build for this one project that I might never touch after I finish. I donâ€™t want to worry if this one package will interfere other packages in my system.</p> <p>I love using tiling window manager. I have tried i3wm but it has more feature than I needed. With dwm, it is written in C and is fairly small. If I need additional features, it have numerous patches like fancy bar and grid mode.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2024-12-09-state-of-laptop/1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2024-12-09-state-of-laptop/1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2024-12-09-state-of-laptop/1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024-12-09-state-of-laptop/1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h3 id="suckless-software-st-dmenu-surf">Suckless software: st, dmenu, surf</h3> <p>Same with dwm, less is more. Before st, I was using Kitty. It works well, but I would like something lightweight. Some of the features I patch st are ligature and w3m support. Dmenu is just something I used to launch applications like the start menu on Windows. Surf is just a web browser in GTK3. I use it as an back up and also a markdown preview.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2024-12-09-state-of-laptop/2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2024-12-09-state-of-laptop/2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2024-12-09-state-of-laptop/2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024-12-09-state-of-laptop/2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h3 id="terminal">Terminal</h3> <p>What is my development environment? I write code and edit files in neovim with tmux. Tmux allows me to spawn many tabs of zsh session. I uses powerlevel10k theme to customize my prompt. My zsh contain plugins like autocomplete and syntax highlighting.</p> <h4 id="neovim">Neovim</h4> <p>I wrote my neovim config by myself with the help of jmbuhr/quarto-nvim-kickstarter git repo. Instead of using LunarVim or NVChad, I want to be conscious of the plugins I use and eliminate ones that I barely use. Sure, it can get frustrating when plugins update and I have to fix my config, but that is the trade off.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2024-12-09-state-of-laptop/3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2024-12-09-state-of-laptop/3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2024-12-09-state-of-laptop/3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024-12-09-state-of-laptop/3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h3> <p>I hope this blog inspire your to customize your Linux.
